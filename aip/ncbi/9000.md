# Adoption of AIPs at NCBI

NCBI has adopted [Google AIPs](https://google.aip.dev/) to guide the basic design and
structure of APIs.  Where changes are needed from the basic guidance, either a specific
entry is made here in the [NCBI section](/ncbi), or in some cases, modifications of
existing AIPs will be allowed.  But we much prefer to extend than to modify.

## How do I make a change?

Create a pull request in the [AIP bitbucket repository](https://bitbucket.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/DT/repos/aip).  See the [contributing page](/contributing) for details.

## How are changes adopted?

A minimal review by the API Working Group co-chairs is required.  Discussion by everyone is encouraged, in the pull-request or in person.  The co-chairs are responsible for identifying the appropriate level of review (working group, TPMs, CTO, SD).  

Current API working group co-chairs:
* Brad Holmes
* Eric Sayers
* Peter Meric

## What are the criteria for altering existing AIPs?

To be decided when that time comes.
